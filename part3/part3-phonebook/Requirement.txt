REACT-DEV-SERVER meaning
 The browser gets the JavaScript from the React dev server, which is the application that runs after running the command npm start. 
 The dev-server transforms the JavaScript into a format understood by the browser. 
 Among other things, it stitches together JavaScript from different files into one file. We'll discuss the dev-server in more detail in part 7 of the course.
